# Response to Reviewer Comment on Code Availability

Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for your valuable suggestion regarding code availability. We have taken the following steps to ensure our analytical code is accessible, anonymized for review, and permanently archived.

## 1. Anonymous Access for Review
All R scripts used in our analyses are available for anonymous review at:
**https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cassava-genetics-analysis-0762/**

The anonymized repository contains:
- Complete R scripts for all four analyses (path analysis, correlation plots, NDVI linear model, NDVI polynomial model)
- All data files in the required format
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- All output figures and tables generated by the analyses

## 2. Permanent Archiving with DOI
The final version of our code is permanently archived in Zenodo with the DOI:
**10.5281/zenodo.18765296**

This DOI ensures that the code is permanently preserved, citable, and the version used in this manuscript is clearly identified.

## 3. Manuscript Update
We have added the following statement to the "Availability of Data and Materials" section of our manuscript:

> **Code Availability**
> 
> The R scripts used for all statistical analyses are available for anonymous review at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cassava-genetics-analysis-0762/
> 
> Upon publication, the final version of all scripts is permanently archived in Zenodo with the DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.18765296](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18765296). The archive includes all scripts necessary to reproduce the path analysis, genotypic correlations, NDVI linear model, and polynomial regression analyses reported in this manuscript.

We believe these actions fully address the reviewer's comment and meet the journal's requirements for code availability.

Sincerely,

The Authors
